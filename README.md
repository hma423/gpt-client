This code generated by chat gpt is supposed to use typescript and materials components to code up a form that would take the following information: name, email, photo, and description. The code is also supposed to allow the useres to preview what their form looks like before submitting and if they don't like it they can go back from the preview and edit what they had. 

- The code does work right now and from a ui stand-point is better than the currnt code that we have as it has animations and shading. 
- The code is worse because for our client we are not using react, but aftr prompted GPT-3.5 automatically decided to write its code using react without beig told so.
- The first code that GPT generated was working first try, but when i prompted it for more styling there were errors that it couldn't debug.
- Really cool to see GPT code work on first try and our team might take some of the logic that it is using and implement it into our own code.
