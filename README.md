- The code does work right now and from a ui stand-point is better than the currnt code that we have as it has animations and shading. 
- The code is worse because for our client we are not using react, but aftr prompted GPT-3.5 automatically decided to write its code using react without beig told so.
- The first code that GPT generated was working first try, but when i prompted it for more styling there were errors that it couldn't debug.
- Really cool to see GPT code work on first try and our team might take some of the logic that it is using and implement it into our own code.
